## Positions database

Thanks [The Week in Chess](https://theweekinchess.com/), for the PGNs. From the first 50 games of the World Rapid 2021 database, I choose two random positions each.

All evaluations were calculated with Stockfish 14.1, to a depth of 25 with NNUE.

Selecting positions for the positions database is difficult. There may be very one-sided positions. Also, the points scoring algorithm may need tweaking. If you know of a possible way to improve the scoring algorithm, please leave create an issue with your idea.
