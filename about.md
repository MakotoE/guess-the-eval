## Positions database

Thanks to [The Week in Chess](https://theweekinchess.com/) for the PGNs. From the 56 games of Candidates Tournament 2022, I choose up to two random positions of each.

All evaluations were calculated with Stockfish 15, to a depth of 30 with NNUE.

Selecting positions for the positions database is difficult. There may be very one-sided positions. Also, the points scoring algorithm may need tweaking. If you know of a possible way to improve the scoring algorithm, please leave create an issue with your idea.
